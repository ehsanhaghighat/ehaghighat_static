It was followed by my studies on mechanics of faults, where contact mechanics and friction is used to describe earthquake. I my current study, I am trying to describe the mechanism on multi-scale implicit interfaces.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Constitutive Modeling</title><link>https://www.ehaghighat.com/research/plasticity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ehaghighat.com/research/plasticity/</guid><description>&lt;p>Modeling material behavior has been a major part of my studies to describe material response at macro-scale. It involves modeling isotropic and anisotropic materials, creep, and degradation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Numerical Methods</title><link>https://www.ehaghighat.com/research/neumerics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ehaghighat.com/research/neumerics/</guid><description>&lt;p>Numerical solution techniques is a great interest of mine and will continue my research on these topics.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

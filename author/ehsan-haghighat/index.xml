This way, not only you will find your personal meal recommendations, for instance most rated burger, but also recommendations from other cuisines that share similar ingredients, such as Mediterranean Kafta or Indian Kebab or Japanese ground beef.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We propose the application of a deep learning framework NRT which can simultaneously predict precise ratings and generate abstractive tips with good linguistic quality simulating user experience and feelings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Constitutive Modeling</title><link>https://www.ehaghighat.com/research/plasticity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ehaghighat.com/research/plasticity/</guid><description>&lt;p>Modeling material behavior has been a major part of my studies to describe material response at macro-scale. It involves modeling isotropic and anisotropic materials, creep, and degradation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Modeling of Fracturing and Localization</title><link>https://www.ehaghighat.com/research/fracture/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ehaghighat.com/research/fracture/</guid><description>&lt;p>Modeling fracture initiation and propagation has been a major active research area. In a set of studies, I have used XFEM and damage mechanics to describe fracture propagation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have then used the framework to model different fracture modes along with experimental validations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My major PHD contribution is description of localization in XFEM framework. Additionally, I re-described the embedded discontinuity model to describe discrete cracking and localization. I have also extended the framework to account for material anisotropy. It also resulted to description of discontinuous Fourier law. An example can be seen here:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After validation of the model on trial axial experiments, we then use the framework to describe slope stability analysis:&lt;/p>

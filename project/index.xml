This way, not only you will find your personal meal recommendations, for instance most rated burger, but also recommendations from other cuisines that share similar ingredients, such as Mediterranean Kafta or Indian Kebab or Japanese ground beef.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We propose the application of a deep learning framework NRT which can simultaneously predict precise ratings and generate abstractive tips with good linguistic quality simulating user experience and feelings.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

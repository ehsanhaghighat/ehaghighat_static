I am trying to describe geo- and solid-mechanics relations in this framework both for data-driven modeling and discovery (inversion).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mechanics of Contact and Impact</title><link>https://www.ehaghighat.com/research/contact/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ehaghighat.com/research/contact/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My tenure at FTI was involved a great amount of research on the mechanics of shells and forming. It was followed by my studies on mechanics of faults, where contact mechanics and friction is used to describe earthquake. I my current study, I am trying to describe the mechanism on multi-scale implicit interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Constitutive Modeling</title><link>https://www.ehaghighat.com/research/plasticity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ehaghighat.com/research/plasticity/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Modeling material behavior has been a major part of my studies to describe material response at macro-scale. It involves modeling isotropic and anisotropic materials, creep, and degradation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Modeling of Fracturing and Localization</title><link>https://www.ehaghighat.com/research/fracture/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ehaghighat.com/research/fracture/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Modeling fracture initiation and propagation has been a major active research area. In a set of studies, I have used XFEM and damage mechanics to describe fracture propagation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have then used the framework to model different fracture modes along with experimental validations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My major PHD contribution is description of localization in XFEM framework. Additionally, I re-described the embedded discontinuity model to describe discrete cracking and localization. I have also extended the framework to account for material anisotropy. It also resulted to description of discontinuous Fourier law. An example can be seen here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After validation of the model on trial axial experiments, we then use the framework to describe slope stability analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

The performance of existing PINN approaches, however, may degrade in the presence of sharp gradients, as a result of the inability of the network to capture the solution behavior globally. We posit that this shortcoming may be remedied by introducing long-range (nonlocal) interactions into the network's input, in addition to the short-range (local) space and time variables. Following this ansatz, here we develop a nonlocal PINN approach using the Peridynamic Differential Operator (PDDO)---a numerical method which incorporates long-range interactions and removes spatial derivatives in the governing equations. Because the PDDO functions can be readily incorporated in the neural network architecture, the nonlocality does not degrade the performance of modern deep-learning algorithms. We apply nonlocal PDDO-PINN to the solution and identification of material parameters in solid mechanics and, specifically, to elastoplastic deformation in a domain subjected to indentation by a rigid punch, for which the mixed displacement--traction boundary condition leads to localized deformation and sharp gradients in the solution. We document the superior behavior of nonlocal PINN with respect to local PINN in both solution accuracy and parameter inference, illustrating its potential for simulation and discovery of partial differential equations whose solution develops sharp gradients.","tags":null,"title":"A nonlocal physics-informed deep learning framework using the peridynamic differential operator","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

We use a Perzyna-type description of viscous deformation that derives from a maximization of dissipated energy during plastic flow, in combination with a modified Cam-clay model of plastic deformation. The plastic flow model is of the associative type, and the viscous deformation is proportional to the ratio of driving stress and a material viscosity. Our model does not rely on any explicit time parameters; therefore, it is well-suited for standard and cyclic loading of materials. We validate the model with recent triaxial experiments of time-dependent deformation in clay-rich (Haynesville Formation) and carbonate-rich (Eagle Ford Formation) shale samples, and we find that the deformation during complex, multiscale loading-unloading paths can be reproduced accurately. We elucidate the role and physical meaning of each model parameter, and we infer their value from a gradient-descent minimization of the error between simulation and experimental data. This inference points to the large, and often unrecognized, uncertainty in the preconsolidation stress, which is key to reproducing the observed hysteresis in material deformation.","tags":null,"title":"A viscoplastic model of creep in shale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

The experimental results show that both strength and deformation of the argillite are direction-dependent. Failure occurs in a brittle manner with a sudden collapse of the material strength. The failure mode exhibits localization along distinct failure planes and also depends on the loading orientation.

A microstructure tensor approach is adopted in order to take into account the anisotropic behaviour of the argillite. The identification procedure for material function and parameters is outlined, and the model is applied to simulate the set of triaxial tests performed at different levels of confining pressure and orientation of the bedding planes.

Structures made of such materials may undergo damage due to several reasons. Here, mechanical loading and chemo-mechanical interactions that result in degradation of strength parameters are considered as the sources of damage initiation. Both tensile and compressive cracks are investigated. For analysis of crack propagation, two different methodologies are employed; the Constitutive Law with Embedded Discontinuity (CLED) and the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM). The CLED approach is enhanced here to describe the discrete nature of crack propagation. This is done by coupling the CLED with explicit modeling of crack path using the Level-Set method. The XFEM is used as a verification tool to check the results from CLED analysis. An algorithm is proposed for crack initiation and propagation that results in stable and a mesh-independent solution. The CLED approach is further improved by developing the return-mapping and closest-point projection algorithms. Extensive numerical investigations are conducted that include mode I cracking in a three point bending test, mode I cracking in notched cantilever beam, mixed cracking mode in a plate subjected to shear and tension, and a mixed mode cracking in a notched beam under four point loading. For frictional interfaces, the shear band formation in a sample subjected to bi-axial compression and the shear band formation in a geo-slope are studied. The thesis also addresses the topic of the response of unsaturated cohesive soils undergoing an infiltration process. The problem is approached within the framework of Chemo-Plasticity. It is assumed that the complex chemo-mechanical interactions are the controlling factors for degradation of strength parameters during this process. A return mapping integration scheme is developed and the approach is employed to investigate the stability of a geoslope subjected to a heavy rainfall. Analysis of shear band formation is further investigated in the context of sedimentary rocks. The microstructure tensor approach is used to describe the inherent anisotropy in this class of materials. The orientation of the shear band is defined by invoking the Critical Plane approach and the closest-point projection algorithm is developed for numerical integration of the governing constitutive relations. The model is used along with CLED for analysis of the mechanical response of Tournemire argillite. It is shown that the friction between loading platens and sample can play an important role in the process of shear band formation and the associated assessment of the ultimate load. A mesh-sensitivity analysis employing the CLED framework is also conducted here. The research clearly demonstrates that the discrete representation of crack path propagation is essential for an accurate analysis of failure in various engineering structures. It is shown that if the classical smeared Constitutive Law with Embedded Discontinuity is enhanced to simulate the discrete nature of the damage process, it can yield very accurate results that are virtually identical to those obtained from discrete approaches such as XFEM.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling of damage propagation in cohesive-frictional materials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haghighat, E and Pietruszczak, S"],"categories":null,"content":"    ","date":1427241600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1427241600,"objectID":"7a826ecd6dda5773bab422a6dd02801b","permalink":"https://www.ehaghighat.com/publication/haghighat2015modeling/","publishdate":"2015-03-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haghighat2015modeling/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, the problem of propagation of localized deformation associated with formation of macrocracks/shear bands is studied in both tensile and compressive regimes.

The fluid flow within the fracture is modeled using the Darcy law, in which the fracture permeability is assumed according to the well-known cubic law. The spatial discretization is performed using the extended finite element method, the time domain discretization is performed based on the generalized Newmark scheme, and the non-linear system of equations is solved using the Newton–Raphson iterative procedure. In the context of the X-FEM, the discontinuity in the displacement field is modeled by enhancing the standard piecewise polynomial basis with the Heaviside and crack-tip asymptotic functions, and the discontinuity in the fluid flow normal to the fracture is modeled by enhancing the pressure approximation field with the modified level-set function, which is commonly used for weak discontinuities. Two alternative computational algorithms are employed to compute the interfacial forces due to fluid pressure exerted on the fracture faces based on a ‘partitioned solution algorithm’ and a ‘time-dependent constant pressure algorithm’ that are mostly applicable to impermeable media, and the results are compared with the coupling X-FEM model. Finally, several benchmark problems are solved numerically to illustrate the performance of the X-FEM method for hydraulic fracture propagation in saturated porous media.","tags":null,"title":"Extended finite element modeling of deformable porous media with arbitrary interfaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ehsan Haghighat"],"categories":["research interests","projects","publications"],"content":"Modeling material behavior has been a major part of my studies to describe material response at macro-scale.

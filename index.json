In this work, we present a PINN approach to solving the equations of coupled flow and deformation in porous media for both single-phase and multiphase flow. To this end, we construct the solution space using multi-layer neural networks. Due to the dynamics of the problem, we find that incorporating multiple differential relations into the loss function results in an unstable optimization problem, meaning that sometimes it converges to the trivial null solution, other times it moves very far from the expected solution. We report a dimensionless form of the coupled governing equations that we find most favourable to the optimizer. Additionally, we propose a sequential training approach based on the stress-split algorithms of poromechanics. Notably, we find that sequential training based on stress-split performs well for different problems, while the classical strain-split algorithm shows an unstable behaviour similar to what is reported in the context of finite element solvers.

An accurate and efficient traveltime computation for P and S waves is crucial for the success of these applications. However, solutions to the Eikonal equation with a complex phase velocity field in anisotropic media is challenging. The Eikonal equation is a first-order, hyperbolic, nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) that represents the high-frequency asymptotic approximation of the wave equation. The fast marching and sweeping methods are commonly used due to their efficiency in numercally solving Eikonal equation. However, these methods suffer from numerical inaccuracy in anisotropic media with sharp heterogeneity, irregular surface topography and complex phase velocity fields. This study presents a new method to solving the Eikonal equation by employing the peridynamic differential operator (PDDO). The PDDO provides the nonlocal form of the Eikonal equation by introducing an internal length parameter (horizon) and a weight function with directional nonlocality. The operator is immune to discontinuities in the form sharp changes in field or model variables and invokes the direction of traveltime in a consistent manner. The weight function controls the degree of association among points within the horizon. Solutions are constructed in a consistent manner without upwind assumptions through simple discretization. The capability of this approach is demonstrated by considering different types of Eikonal equations on complex velocity models in anisotropic media.","tags":null,"title":"Solving the Eikonal equation for compressional and shear waves in anisotropic media using peridynamic differential operator","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Umair bin Waheed","Tariq Alkhalifah","Ehsan Haghighat","Chao Song","Jean Virieux"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614643200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614643200,"objectID":"66edc434e60ff28cd1d9b1099f72ccf1","permalink":"https://www.ehaghighat.com/publication/pub_2021_2/","publishdate":"2021-03-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2021_2/","section":"publication","summary":"Seismic traveltime tomography using transmission data is widely used to image the Earth's interior from global to local scales.

Despite these advances, there is no mechanism in these algorithms to carry on information gained by solving one problem to the next. Moreover, these approaches may breakdown for certain complex forms of the eikonal equation, requiring approximation methods to estimate the solution.

We propose a new method that replaces the computationally expensive parts of the hydrodynamic models with simple and efficient data-driven approximations. Our hypothesis is that by integrating ML with physics-based numerical methods, we can achieve improved generalization performance: that is, the trained model for one case study can be used in other studies without the need for new training. We tested two ML approaches: for the first, we integrated curve fitting, and, for the second, artificial neural networks (ANN) with a finite volume scheme to solve the local inertial approximation of the SWEs. The data-driven models approximated the Momentum Equation, which explicitly solved the time derivative of flow rates. Water depths were then updated by applying a water balance equation. We also tested two different training datasets: the simulated dataset, generated from the results of hydrodynamic model, and the random dataset, generated by directly solving the momentum equation on randomly sampled input data. Various combinations of input features, for example, water slope and depth, were explored. The proposed models were trained in a small hypothetical case and tested in a different hypothetical and in two real case studies. Results showed that the curve-fitting method can be implemented successfully, given sufficient training and input data. The ANN model trained with a random dataset was substantially more accurate than that of the model trained with the simulated dataset. However, it was not successful in the real case studies. The curve-fitting method resulted in better generalization performance and increased the simulation speed of the local inertial model by 23%.

We use a Perzyna-type description of viscous deformation that derives from a maximization of dissipated energy during plastic flow, in combination with a modified Cam-clay model of plastic deformation. The plastic flow model is of the associative type, and the viscous deformation is proportional to the ratio of driving stress and a material viscosity. Our model does not rely on any explicit time parameters; therefore, it is well-suited for standard and cyclic loading of materials. We validate the model with recent triaxial experiments of time-dependent deformation in clay-rich (Haynesville Formation) and carbonate-rich (Eagle Ford Formation) shale samples, and we find that the deformation during complex, multiscale loading-unloading paths can be reproduced accurately. We elucidate the role and physical meaning of each model parameter, and we infer their value from a gradient-descent minimization of the error between simulation and experimental data. This inference points to the large, and often unrecognized, uncertainty in the preconsolidation stress, which is key to reproducing the observed hysteresis in material deformation.","tags":null,"title":"A viscoplastic model of creep in shale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

The experimental results show that both strength and deformation of the argillite are direction-dependent. Failure occurs in a brittle manner with a sudden collapse of the material strength. The failure mode exhibits localization along distinct failure planes and also depends on the loading orientation.

Structures made of such materials may undergo damage due to several reasons. Here, mechanical loading and chemo-mechanical interactions that result in degradation of strength parameters are considered as the sources of damage initiation. Both tensile and compressive cracks are investigated. For analysis of crack propagation, two different methodologies are employed; the Constitutive Law with Embedded Discontinuity (CLED) and the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM). The CLED approach is enhanced here to describe the discrete nature of crack propagation. This is done by coupling the CLED with explicit modeling of crack path using the Level-Set method. The XFEM is used as a verification tool to check the results from CLED analysis. An algorithm is proposed for crack initiation and propagation that results in stable and a mesh-independent solution. The CLED approach is further improved by developing the return-mapping and closest-point projection algorithms. Extensive numerical investigations are conducted that include mode I cracking in a three point bending test, mode I cracking in notched cantilever beam, mixed cracking mode in a plate subjected to shear and tension, and a mixed mode cracking in a notched beam under four point loading. For frictional interfaces, the shear band formation in a sample subjected to bi-axial compression and the shear band formation in a geo-slope are studied. The thesis also addresses the topic of the response of unsaturated cohesive soils undergoing an infiltration process. The problem is approached within the framework of Chemo-Plasticity. It is assumed that the complex chemo-mechanical interactions are the controlling factors for degradation of strength parameters during this process. A return mapping integration scheme is developed and the approach is employed to investigate the stability of a geoslope subjected to a heavy rainfall. Analysis of shear band formation is further investigated in the context of sedimentary rocks. The microstructure tensor approach is used to describe the inherent anisotropy in this class of materials. The orientation of the shear band is defined by invoking the Critical Plane approach and the closest-point projection algorithm is developed for numerical integration of the governing constitutive relations. The model is used along with CLED for analysis of the mechanical response of Tournemire argillite. It is shown that the friction between loading platens and sample can play an important role in the process of shear band formation and the associated assessment of the ultimate load. A mesh-sensitivity analysis employing the CLED framework is also conducted here. The research clearly demonstrates that the discrete representation of crack path propagation is essential for an accurate analysis of failure in various engineering structures. It is shown that if the classical smeared Constitutive Law with Embedded Discontinuity is enhanced to simulate the discrete nature of the damage process, it can yield very accurate results that are virtually identical to those obtained from discrete approaches such as XFEM.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling of damage propagation in cohesive-frictional materials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haghighat, E and Pietruszczak, S"],"categories":null,"content":"    ","date":1427241600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1427241600,"objectID":"89588edffa54ba4b7d6e36e4cef1d361","permalink":"https://www.ehaghighat.com/publication/pub_2015_3/","publishdate":"2015-03-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_2015_3/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, the problem of propagation of localized deformation associated with formation of macrocracks/shear bands is studied in both tensile and compressive regimes.
